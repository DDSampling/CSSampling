To run CSSampling in one dataset :
Run the terminal into the CSSampling folder
#CSSampling.py Data\dataset N M indiceClass

N is the size of the sample
M is the maximum norm

if there is no class, then indiceClass=-1
indiceClass is the index of the attribute to predict if it exists, else it takes -1. indiceClass=0 if the index is the first one
Exemple :
CSSampling.py Data\D100K5S2T6I.txt 10000 3 -1
